# Lightweight neural architectures by example - car model classification using GhostNet

Training [GhostNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11907) on [Stanford Cars Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html).

Full project documentation and step-by-step training process description, along with tips to reproduce the experimentation setup either locally (Windows/Linux) or on Google Colab available in [documentation](https://github.com/pchaberski/cars/tree/master/documentation) folder.

Summary slides in PDF available [here](https://github.com/pchaberski/cars/blob/master/documentation/pdf_conversion/slides.pdf).

Neptune.ai project with summary dashboard, logs, experiment parameters and interactive plots available [here](https://ui.neptune.ai/pchaberski/cars/experiments?viewId=ae19164c-ee09-4209-8798-a424142d2082).

Additionally, to see the approach to the same problem with another architecture ([EfficientNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946)) and the difference between using pretrained and not pretrained networks, check [matkalinowski's repo](https://github.com/matkalinowski/dnn).
