# 3. Experimentation setup

The experimentation setup is entirely based on Python. GhostNet (and some other networks, which also can be used) implementation is written in PyTorch. Training process is orchestrated using `pytorch-lightning` package and controlled by parameters passed through YAML config file. Neptune.ai experiment management tool (https://neptune.ai/) was used for experiment tracking. To build an environment for data preparation and model training Python `virtual env` utility was used. In addition to local training setup there is also a possibility to recreate the project environment and run training on Google Colab platform using a prepared Jupyter Notebook.
